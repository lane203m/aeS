Interactive game on sea life, preservation, and sustainability 

## The main vision, idea, area (etc.)

aeS aims to be a new web/mobile platform seeking to provide daily interaction/learning through the form of learning activities/games that the user must frequent. One issue with many environmental learning games is that they are quite often one-and-done activities. You browse the game, learn and never come back. It’s very hard to appreciate the importance of an endeavor with these types of games. Infact, many mobile learning games are more “fun” than effective. I hope to foster a community that brings back visitors, who wish to observe the fruits of the game communitie’s labors. “winning” the game will be a group effort, and will encourage students to return. Upon returning, we hope to draw their attention back to the SDG at hand with new news/information.
